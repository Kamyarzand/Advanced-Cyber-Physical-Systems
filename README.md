# Advanced Cyber-Physical Systems

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the **Advanced Cyber-Physical Systems** course. The project explores cutting-edge concepts in integrating computational and physical processes, with a focus on real-world applications and advanced methodologies.

## Features
- Implementation of key cyber-physical system components.
- Simulation and testing of system interactions.
- Comprehensive documentation and use cases.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** [e.g., Python, C++, Java]  
- **Tools & Libraries:** [e.g., ROS, MATLAB, TensorFlow]  
- **Development Environment:** [e.g., VS Code, JetBrains, Linux]

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code for system implementation.
- `docs/`: Documentation and reports.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
- `assets/`: Diagrams, models, and visual content.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
